              <p>Started high school at Saint Francis Preparatory School in Fresh Meadows, NY. "The proud traditions of St. Francis Preparatory School stretch back over 150 years to a simple building on Baltic Street in Brooklyn, New York. There, in the Fall of 1858, the doors of what was then St. Francis Academy opened for the very first time. The school has twice relocated, first in 1952 to North Sixth Street, again in 1974 to its present location in Queens, and has since been providing intellectual and spiritual growth to young men and women who seek the finest Catholic education available.
   The Franciscan traditions of peace, love and respect for the individual, community, and environment are the fundamental building blocks of the St. Francis Prep Education. The abilities of our students are nurtured and strengthened in an environment centered around the teachings of Jesus Christ. St. Francis Prep is a community of learning and teaching, committed to maintaining the standard of excellence which has been in place since its founding." </p>
